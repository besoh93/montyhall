# Monty Hall Problem
The **Monty Hall Problem** is a fun puzzle in which you are given a chance to choose one out of the three doors.
Behind the doors, there are two goats and a car and the goal is to select the car.
After choosing one of the doors, the host will unlock one of the remaining two doors which has a goat, and you are allowed to keep your choice or switch to the last remaining door. 

You can read more about this problem on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

After miserably failing to convince my friends that switching the door at the end increases your chances of winning the car, I had to write a code in Python to prove it by trying.

I wrote a simple code in both Python and PHP, this way I could also show him how similar programming languages are to each other, as he's new to learning Python.
